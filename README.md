## Introduction
Welcome to the Gesture Recognition System repository! This project aims to develop a real-time gesture recognition system using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. By detecting and interpreting hand gestures, this system enables users to interact with devices and applications without physical contact.

## Implementation
To achieve our goal, we have developed the following process:
- Obtain image data from the peripheral device.
- Process the image to detect hands.
- Use landmark points of detected hands to capture real-time changes in hand movements.
- Utilize hand gestures to call in controlled actions.

## Identification of Hands
Using Mediapipe and OpenCV, we locate the hand and its 21 landmark points. These landmark points provide crucial data for hand identification and command detection. Specific criteria, such as finger positions and hand orientation, are utilized to distinguish between left and right hands.

## Hand Gestures Detection
Hand gestures are interpreted as commands to perform actions. Open and closed finger gestures are detected by analyzing landmark point coordinates. With each finger capable of giving two signals, a wide range of commands can be generated by combining different finger gestures.

## Command and Trigger
The system detects hand gestures in real-time and triggers corresponding tasks based on predefined command mappings. A command queue ensures uniqueness and prevents redundancy in task execution. A trigger mechanism is implemented to execute tasks when specific criteria are met.
# Virtual Keyboard 

## Virtual keyboard Introduction
A virtual keyboard enables users to input text or commands using gestures or movements, eliminating the need for a physical keyboard. This technology relies on computer vision techniques, such as image or video processing, to track and analyze user movements. In our virtual keyboard implementation, we capture input data from the user's hand gestures and interpret them to identify the intended characters or commands.

## Enable Virtual Keyboard by Specific Hand-Gestures Command
To enable the virtual keyboard, we have defined a specific command triggered by hand gestures. When the user's hand gesture matches the predefined command array, the virtual keyboard is activated. The command array maps hand gestures to specific functions, such as displaying the virtual keyboard on the screen.




## Conclusion
The Gesture Recognition System offers an intuitive and hands-free interaction solution. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, it enables seamless communication between users and devices. Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute to the project's development!
